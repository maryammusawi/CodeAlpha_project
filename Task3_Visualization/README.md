# 📊 Task 3: Book Title Analysis Visualization

Hey there! This is my visualization project for CodeAlpha's Data Analytics internship. I analyzed the length patterns of book titles from a scraped dataset.

## What I Did

1. **Loaded the data**: Used the `books.csv` file we created in Task 1 (web scraping).
2. **Processed the titles**: Calculated character length for each title.
3. **Created a histogram**: Visualized the distribution of title lengths.

## 🔍 Key Findings

- Most titles fall between **15-30 characters**
- Very short titles (<10 chars) are surprisingly rare
- There's a gradual decline in frequency as titles get longer

## Final Thoughts
This project helped me understand how even simple visualizations can reveal interesting patterns. Next time, I'd compare title lengths across different genres!
